# PSTeamViewer

PSTeamViewer is a Powershell Module to interact with the [TeamViewer API](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/integrations/).

To be able to use the API you need to register an application on your [Teamviewer account](https://login.teamviewer.com) by either creating an APP or a script token.

More information about authentication can be found in [chapter 3 OAuth 2.0 Authorization](https://dl.tvcdn.de/integrate/TeamViewer_API_Documentation.pdf#page=11) (located on page 11 at the time of writing) of the [API documentation](https://dl.tvcdn.de/integrate/TeamViewer_API_Documentation.pdf).

Once you've created your Token or clientID and secret you're good to go.
